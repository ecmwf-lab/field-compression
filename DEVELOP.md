# Development notes

## Docstrings Style

Use [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#google-vs-numpy).

Note that type hints are intentionally not rendered as some of them become too complex and are better described in prose, following xarray's style.


## Versioning

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).


## Utilities
